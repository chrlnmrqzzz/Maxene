            <h3>Things I Hate</h3>
            <p>Woof, human, we need to have a serious pup-talk. You see, being cooped up in that cage feels like having my freedom put on a leash. I get it, you've got your reasons ‚Äì maybe it's for my safety or because you're out and about. But, let me tell you, nothing ruffles my fur more than feeling confined.

        <h2>More about me</h2>
        <p>Hello there, paws and ears! I'm a proud Dachshund, and I've got a long body, short legs, and a personality as big as my bark. They say good things come in small packages, and that's definitely true for us Doxies! </p>
             <p>We were originally bred to hunt badgers, believe it or not! That's right, I may be pint-sized, but I've got the heart of a little hunter. Today, though, I'd much rather cuddle up on the couch with you and be the best four-legged friend you've ever had.</p>
                 <p>So, whether I'm on the scent of a fascinating smell or cozied up in your lap, life with a Dachshund is a delightful adventure. Ready for some tail-wagging fun with your new favorite hot dog? üêæ </p>
